# P3_01_Xcodeproject

This app was created for my 3rd project, "Create an entertaining app right off the bat!" on OpenClassrooms.

This app prompts players to tell a story, either by sharing an experience from the past or by talking about future plans. The app generates a story prompt for the player to use.
Some example story prompts include: "Where do you see yourself in 3 weeks?" or "Where were you 1 year ago?" The phrases use either the PAST or FUTURE & include a time indicator.

Once players have generated a prompt & have told their story, they can then verbally nominate the next person to play & press either PAST or FUTURE to generate a new prompt 
& continue playing.

The project code consists of constants, integers, arrays, functions, labels & buttons that ultimately compose the layout of the view. This application is designed to run on iOS 14
on iPhones in portrait mode.
